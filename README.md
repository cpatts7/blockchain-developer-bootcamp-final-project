Be The Bookie

Most centralized betting sites (bet365 for example) make odds on sporting events and typically earn profit by using spreads. They aim to build a book on both sides that offers them risk free profits by taking the spread in between odds (ie: 5%).

This project (Be-The-Bookie) aims to disrupt this business model by removing the need for this middle man in between. Particpants can either make a market on a match (be a bookie) or take a bet on a particular result. The app will leverage an oracle to determine who is paid out in the end.
